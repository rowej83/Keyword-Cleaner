Keyword-Cleaner

This app was made in order to parse out the results of a combination of tools that will provide a user with a sortable table relating to SEO Keyword search volume and Cost Per Click price and competition. The tool also enables the user to easily export this information in to excel for further processing.

This tool was built using Vuejs (https://vuejs.org/) and Element UI library (http://element.eleme.io/#/en-US) 

The two tools needed for this are http://keywordshitter.com/ and the Keywords Everywhere chrome extension (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keywords-everywhere-keywo/hbapdpeemoojbophdfndmlgdhppljgmp?hl=en).
